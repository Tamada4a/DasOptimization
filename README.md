# DasOptimization

DasOptimization is a lightweight, robust and scalable library capable of solving a system of nonlinear equations and unconstrained nonlinear optimization. Analytical gradient, the Jacobian or the Hessian can be supplied but if they are not available, they will be calculated with finite differences. DasOptimization can recover from singular Hessian and Jacobian matrices and the library employs two descent algorithms; Line Search and Trust-Region-Dogleg algorithm.
