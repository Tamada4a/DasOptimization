# DasOptimization

DasOptimization is an optimization library in progress. I started coding this library due to lack of an open source pure Java 
optimization library.

DasOptimization is planned to contain following modules:
- Nonlinear equation solver
- Unconstrained nonlinear optimizer
- Nonlinear optimization with equality and inequality constraints
- Supports analytical, finite difference approximation, BFGS or L-BFGS gradient or Hessian

Currently, only nonlinear equation solver is complete and the library is planned to be fully functional at late August 2017.

DasOptimization uses EJML for matrix operations.
